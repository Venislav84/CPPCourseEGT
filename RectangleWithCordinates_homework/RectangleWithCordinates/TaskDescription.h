// Create class rectangle that stores only the Cartesian coordinates of the four corners of the rectangle.
// The constructor calls a set function that accepts four sets of cordinates and verifies that each of these is in the first quadrant
// with no single x- or y-coordinate larger than 20.0. 
// The set function also verifies taht the supplied coordinates do, in fact, specify a rectangle. 
// Provide member functions that calculate the length, width, perimeter and area. The length is the larger of the two dimensions.
// Include a predicate function square that determines whether the rectangle is a square.
